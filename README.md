This is the base template for Ionic starter apps.

## Using this project

You need docker and docker compose installed

docker-compose -f dev.yml up -d

image will contain all node packages required to run

put your code in the src/pages folder

you can now browse to your app under port 8100 (ip should be checked via docker)
```
